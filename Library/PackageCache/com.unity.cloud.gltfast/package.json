    "changelog": "### Added\n- Package coherence tests that make sure package versions match across exported generator string and documentation.\n\n### Changed\n- Moved code examples that are referenced by the documentation into a different folder (`DocExamples`).\n- Renamed code example assembly/namespace to `GLTFast.Documentation.Examples` for consistency.\n\n### Fixed\n- (Test) LoadTests on Android now succeed by using `UnityWebRequest` to retrieve data from the compressed JAR file.\n- Loading glTFs from `StreamingAssets` with relative URIs containing Unicode characters on Android. UriHelper.GetBaseUri and UriHelper.GetUriString handle Android `jar:file://` schema URIs with unicode characters correctly (fixes [#667](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast/issues/667)).\n- XML documentation fixes\n- Removed unnecessary \"type\" property from `package.json`.\n- Removed warning about obsolete `GraphicsDeviceType.OpenGLES2` in Unity 2023.1 or newer.\n- (Export) Missing texture transform if texture on glTFast material was scaled vertically only.\n- Improved reliability by adding null checks and imprecision-aware floating-point comparisons in various places.\n- Using immutable fields only in hash code calculation for `ImageExport` classes.\n- Refactored `GetHashCode` implementations referencing mutable fields to avoid potential unexpected behavior.\n  - `TextureComparer.Equals` made `GetHashCode`/`Equals` for `TextureBase` obsolete, so they've been removed.\n  - `MeshPrimitiveComparer` is now used for clustering mesh primitives (instead of `GetHashCode`/`Equals` on `MeshPrimitive` and sub-types).\n- Set minimum required Unity version to 2020.3.48f1 in the documentation.\n- (Export) Avoid potential loss of data by allocating output streams persistently.\n- (Test) Render export test inconclusive if the result has not been validated.\n- (Test) More explicit error message by throwing innermost exception while preserving the stack trace during async tests.\n- (Documentation) Various clarifications, improvements and fixes, based on user feedback.\n\n### Removed\n- Outdated and unused code coverage badge."
